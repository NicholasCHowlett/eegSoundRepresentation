# An aural representation of a participant's electroencephalography (EEG) recording.

The EEG recording will be captured from a low-cost, brain-computer interface developed by OpenBCI. The EEG signal will be represented as frequencies (versus power), then will be used as an 'input gain' into the sound generation domain.

The current project scope will be the first attempt of a neuro-feedback system, where the real-time brain activity is aurally experienced by the participant.
